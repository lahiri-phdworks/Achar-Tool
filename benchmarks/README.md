# Directory Structure

- The directory `C_instances` consists of 133 C programs, their program graphs and their verification conditions we collected to evaluate Code2Inv.

- The directory `Opaque_Examples` consists of 15 C programs, their program graphs and their verification conditions for evaluation of our tool containing opaque operations.

- The directory `NN_Example` consists of MNIST RQ3 CNN C++ example and it's program graph and verification condition. This is the neural network example.

- The directory `Hybrid Examples` consists of 10 C programs, their program graphs and their verification conditions to demonstrate Hybrid Strategy.

- The directory `hybrid_loop` consists of 133 C programs, their program graphs and their verification conditions where one statement in `loop-body` is considered
  to be an opaque operation.

- The directory `hybrid_pre` consists of 133 C programs, their program graphs and their verification conditions where one statement in `pre-body` is considered
  to be an opaque operation.
